**Q1	Identify and explain common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages**

In web development, a markup language is the used to create a website. The markup language itself does not appear on the screen, but it does handle the formatting and structure of the website. The markup language gives the web browser instructions for what each component of the website therefore how and where it should be displayed. (p101 Hirwade)

Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the most common markup language, however, some others that exist include Dynamic HTML (DHTML), Extensible HTML (XHTML) and Extensible Markup Language (XML). (p104 Hirwade)

The common and important components across these markup languages is the use of a combination of symbols and plain text. HTML is mostly written with the angle brackets<>, where there is an opening set < > and a closing set that adds a backslash </ >. 
A H tag with a number would indicate a heading with a size (1 being the largest) while a P tag would indicate a paragraph. A common example would be < h1 >This is a Heading< /h1> or < p>This is a paragraph< /p>. (p6 Cottrell)

XHTML was an upgraded version of HTML created to fix some of the flaws, mostly relating to syntax. Developers now had to pay more attention to making sure all tags were closed and nested properly, all in lowercase. Attributes applied to a tag had to be in quotation marks. For example, <p id=”main-text”>This is the main paragraph.</p> (p6 Cottrell)


DHTML is a markup language that combines elements of HTML for authoring a website, Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) for styling, and Javascript for programming. It allows the developer to create highly interactive websites. It is sometimes referred to as DOM scripting. (p254 Cottrell)

**Q4	Identify THREE data structures used in the Python programming language and explain the reasons for using each.**

**Q5	Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.**

**Q6	Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.**

**Q7	Identify TWO ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue.

List of topics containing ethical issues:
 - access to a user’s personal information (medical, family, financial, personal attributes such as sexuality, religion, or beliefs)
 - intellectual property, copyright, and acknowledgement.
 - criminal acts such as theft, fraud, trafficking and distribution of prohibited substances, terrorism
 - GPS tracking data and other types of metadata, MAC addresses, hardware fingerprints
 - freedom of thought, conscience, speech and the media
 - aggressive sales and marketing practices designed to mislead and deceive consumers
 - trading of shares on the stock exchange OR crypto-currencies

For each ethical issue identify a source of legal information relating to the ethical issue and discuss whether the law is helpful in assisting a developer to act in an ethical way. (Word count guide: 200 words max)

Conduct research into a case study of ONE of the ethical issues you have chosen discuss how an ethical IT professional should respond to the case study and how they might mitigate or prevent ethical breaches. (Word count guide: 400 - 600 words)
